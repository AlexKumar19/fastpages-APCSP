<p>we covered #7 and #9, which are:</p>

<p>Develop Web and online projects.
For #7, I worked with my group to form a frontend for our project. This HTML is then converted and displayed in the client’s browser, showing them the webpage. Fastpages does all the work for us transferring the code and outputting it. Fastpages takes care of the frontend</p>

<p>As for #9, I created a flask based server that runs an api to that the front end can access it. We also worked with fastpages to connect with the backend this way the multiple platforms can communicate and send data to each other.</p>

<p>I want to work with the 8th standard which is creating databases. I really want to work with databases becauses it will allow our scru project to go to the next level and store more data allowing for more innovation.</p>

<p>I will be able to develop my skills as a software engineer because managing data is extremely important as a software engineer. This will help me be more organize and I can apply it to future projects or internships</p>
