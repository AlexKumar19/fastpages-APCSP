    "# Changing Theme from Minima to DarkMode\n",
    "Some things that I noticed when changing the theme to darkmode was that I could not do it through the index.htmlm and I was forced to do it through the _sass file.\n",
    "- The entire background including the header and footer was changed to black ad the text was changed\n",
    "- the fonts where changed and the color changed to white\n",
    "- One thing that I had to come accross was the the fonts did not contrast well because it was just black and white and I did not really like that.\n",
    "- Another thing was that the font was different, although it was still legible I liked the old one better\n",
    "- the installation process of getting the themes in was creating a new folder in the _sass folder and putting the darkmode code it, and the process was very smooth"
