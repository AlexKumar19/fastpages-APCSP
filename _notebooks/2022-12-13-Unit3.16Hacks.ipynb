    "- What makes it a simulation?\n",
    "  - A simulation is a automated process made to replicate a situation to get the output or practice.\n",
    "- What are it’s advantages and disadvantages? \n",
    "  - Some advantages are that it is easier and it takes less resources to actually do vs an experiment where is can be costly and hard. A disadvantage is that it is not as accurate as it does not take into account the outside factors\n",
    "- In your opinion, would an experiment be better in this situation?\n",
    "  - It depends on the situation"

    "- You can simulate picking a random card from a deck of cards\n",
    "- Since there are 52 cards you will need to have some type of random number generator and assign each number to a card so when it randomly picks a card it will match it to a number\n",
    "- This is a simulation because it is not real and uses code to replicate\n",
    "- Its easier than actually picking a card however it is not accurate\n",
