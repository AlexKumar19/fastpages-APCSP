  <li>One thing that I really liked about this quiz was how it emphasized the importance of having multiple perspectives
    <ul>
      <li>In my own scrum team, we highly value collaboration and using multiple perspectives to solve problems and this is why I was able to relate to this quiz and it was a good review on the main ideas of working as groups!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<ul>
  <li>One Question that I have for this specific quiz is why the equal signs appear as arrows in the college board mcqs</li>
  <li>I also really liked the nested loop question because it took a lot of time to understand it, however in the end I was able to see what the code was doing!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>I found the loop that outputs the odd numbers to be very good because it uses many loops to print out the numbers with the least amount of code blocks</li>
  <li>I have the same question again with the arrows and why they don’t use equal signs</li>
</ul>
