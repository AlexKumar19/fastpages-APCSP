  <li>This final mc was pretty hard compared to the shorter mc practices that we did before.</li>
  <li>Some common errors that I made in the quiz was in 2B. The develop and integrate algorithms. This topic is somewhere that i can work with. In my own code this main idea of 2B would look like creating functions to manage the complexity. I need to work on understanding the purpose more.</li>
  <li>Another main idea that i missed is 4B, evaluating  and testing algorithms. This means that I need to have a better understanding of what these algorithms do because in the quiz I was making a lot of mistakes with finding errors in the code and figuring out what the problems are in the code. This is very important because if I am able to get better at evaluating algorithms I can make my code more organized and find errors faster.</li>
  <li>Along with this, I made a lot of errors with 4C, this is more of the testing and finding errors in my code with algorithms, the questions often showed me code with errors and I would have to find out the error.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the questions that I got wrong in this practice
<img src="/fastpages-APCSP/images/p1.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>The issue that I made in this problem was that instead of looking for numbers less than the desired value I instead put numbers more, this was a simple error because i thought it was a &gt; sign instead of a &lt; sign and this ended with me making that simple error</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/fastpages-APCSP/images/p2.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>the error inside of this proble was that I overlooked the fact that it did not replace the values, instead it creates a new list that simply reverses the positions of the values and creates a new list. This is different than what I thought because earlier I thought that it was just reverses the values</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/fastpages-APCSP/images/p3.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>The error in this code was that I though the value was getting compared to all the other values inside of the list, however instead it only starts iterating through the list starting at value K. This way it only compares it to values after.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/fastpages-APCSP/images/p4.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>this problem was witha conceptually understanding of the internet and the purpose of using protocols. instead they work to standardized instead of protect. this is why i got this problem wrong</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/fastpages-APCSP/images/p5.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>This problem is wrong because I did not have a good understanding of how binary worked before taking this test. after further research an lerning about what binary is used for and how it is used. The way this works is with 2 and 2^x depending on which column it is in.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/fastpages-APCSP/images/p5.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>This was a minor conceptually error because this was at a first glance right however in the algorithm, the list was then swtiched.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/fastpages-APCSP/images/p7.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>In this problem, I made a simple mistake of not noticing that in the end of the algorithm, it sets the value to 50 so no matter of what the input it, in the end it would always give the same output and this is why this problem was wrong because I did not notice the little code block in the end</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/fastpages-APCSP/images/p8.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
  <li>This problem is simply wrong because I used the wrong system to solve. The thing does not interchange the values and instead it sets both to the first value. this is wrong because the purpose of the code is to instead swap the values instead of setting them both to the first value and this is why it is wrong.</li>
</ul>
