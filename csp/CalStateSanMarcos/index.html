The notes highlighted several areas of study, such as physics, computer science, and biological sciences, as well as programs like cybersecurity and computer engineering. Additionally, CSSM’s focus on social mobility and providing opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds to achieve academic and career success was commendable.Another important aspect of the presentation was the discussion of challenges that students at CSSM may face. For example, the pandemic has impacted the ability of students to fully experience the campus and its resources. Additionally, college debt is a real concern for many students, and the presentation stressed the importance of being aware of the resources available to help mitigate the financial burden of higher education. Overall, the presentation provided valuable insight into the experiences of students at CSSM and the opportunities and challenges that come with pursuing higher education.
