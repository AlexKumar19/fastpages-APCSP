  <li>Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit
    <ol>
      <li>The timer allows users to manage their schedules</li>
      <li>The todo list can help users keep track of their ideas and goals</li>
      <li>the notes function will help people stay organized with their homework and class notes</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Think of a potential harmful effect of your project
    <ol>
      <li>One potential harmful thing is that people will become to reliant on the calculator and will not be able to do simple math after</li>
    </ol>

  <li>Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admi password on lab machines at school?
    <ol>
      <li>One pro is that it makes students stay on task and focus on their school work instead of doing things like playing games or watching youtube videos as these can be distracting. One con is that often when trying to find data or information online some websites may be blocked for being a distraction when they actually are not. This can prevent or slow down learning when it is a struggle to find information online and the sites are blocked for security reasons</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? for oyuself or for others?
    <ol>
      <li>I think that for myself I will be at a benefit because I have access to the internet as well as a laptop that will give me access to a wealth of knowledge online. This is very unfair, because some people that are not as fortunate and will not be able to learn as quickly. They will not be able to get access to all the infromation as me and they will have slower learning efficiency. Some technologies such as canvas and google drive and desmos really help me with visuals and understanding the concepts.</li>
