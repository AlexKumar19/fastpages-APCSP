</ul><ul>
  <li>Each individual preforms starts “pre-view” outline/write up of materials requried for College Board
    <ul>
      <li>For my video submission, in order to meet the College Board requirements for the Performance task, I need to show the input and output and the program working. I also need to show what is the purpose of the program and emphasize what the program does with the user input. I also need to have data abstraction in my program, this can be in the form of a list that stores the data of the user. In my video I also need to show off the use of sequencing selection and iteration for my algorithms in order to show off how I am using functions to simplifiy the process. I need to explain the algorithms in order to show off complexity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Describe the portion of the Project you will use for Create Performance task
    <ul>
      <li>In our SAAKD group, I will show off my feature that allows the user to time their tasks by storing the users input into a table and having a timer inside of the html that will track the time it takes for their activities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Describe code plan as it is required for CB
    <ul>
      <li>My plan is to have a function that will be able to take in the users input, for expected time and also the name of the task. This function will store all the data in a list and also it will start a timer. Another function will be used to add the entries from this list and put it in the form of a html table and give output to the user so they can see the live action timer. Finally I will also use another funciton that will be able to take entries from the list and remove them in case the user is done with an adtivity. The list that is behind the code poses as my data abstration as it can be easy to iterate through in order to quickly populate the table with data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consider what will be demonstrated in the video
    <ul>
      <li>In my video I will give a brief overview of the code quickly showing off the functionality and how it is used. Then I will continue explain what the purpose of it as I go over one example of my adding a class with an expected time. Then I will wait, pause the timer and delete it to show off all the functionality of my project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
