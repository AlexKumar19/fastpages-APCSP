  <li>I got a 48/50

</li>
  <li>In this MCQ I had a lot of practice with algorithms and understanding the purpose and function behind them. I also was able to learn from my mistakes and think about the functions in a different way. For example question 7, I learned how to check for different conditions and see about how to think about it in a different way.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>This answer is wrong because I made a simple reading error. In this example it takes about a simple function that would predict whether an book is borrowed. It would not make sense to take the product between them</li>
  <li>In order for this to be true, it would make sense to add them and see if the product is even because that means that the returns and buys are equal for it to be a even number</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>This is an if statement inside of another if statement. This represents the beggining statement as it can check for two different conditions, and if the conditions are true it will give the proper answer</li>
</ul>
