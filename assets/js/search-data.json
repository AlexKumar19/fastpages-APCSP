Volume and mass increase proportionally (because the density is the same) so the only thing that is changing in this lab is the area which is piR2 so it is changing proportionally to r2.

Considering the mathematical relationship between disk radius r and disk mass m . (equation 4), what does the independent variable from your line of best fit represent? . The independent variable from the line of best fit represents the radius of the aluminum disk because the mass is dependent on the radius therefore the radius is considered the independent variable . | . 2. Use the mathematical relationship between mass of the disk m and the disk’s . radius r to equate the coefficient values from your line of best fit to physical . quantities. What are the units for each? . . The slope represents the constants (density, pi, and height). In the equation that we made, the slope shows that mass and radius^2 are proportional. . 3. Should you adjust the best-fit line to be sure it passes through the origin, (0,0)? . Justify your answer. . No, you shouldn’t, because the y-intercept can help show that the data has an error, and moving it to fit (0,0) would hide the error and display false results. . 4. Using the slope of your best fit line and your measured value for disk thickness, . determine the experimental value for the disk material density. How does this value . compared to the theoretical value provided by your teacher? What is your percent . Error? . Theoretical density = 2.7 g/cm^3 . Percent difference = 42.8% . . 5. What are some of the factors that may have caused error and how might these . Factors have been prevented? . Some of the factors that may cause the error are manual and non digital measurement. For example the radius measurements and the thickness measurements. To prevent these human errors, we could use digital measurements to get the exact values. . Synthesis Questions: . In this experiment, if we had used disks with a greater thickness, would the slope of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be the same? Explain. . | The slope of the line of best fit would change because if the thickness increases, the mass would increase and in order for the equation to stay accurate, the slope will have to increase because mass is the dependent variable. The density would be the same because mass and the volume would still increase proportionally. . How would your graph of m versus r2 be different if you had used disks of the same thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m versus r2 plot that represents disks made of steel. . | The line would be different because the slope would be different. The density of steel is 7.85 g/cm^3 however the density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3. In this lab, the slope is pi*height*density and since the density is different by a factor of 2.5, the slope of the steel graph will be 2.5 times greater. . Aluminum equation/graph: 0.015585x -0.042943 . Steel equation/graph: 0.035067x-0.096621 . . 3. Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; . however, their disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to . determine. The group’s m versus r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the density of the unknown material and use the table below to help determine what material their disks are made of. . . Multiple Choice questions: . 1. You perform the same experiment, but this time you plot a linear relationship . between mass and the circumference of the disks rather than the radius. What is the . slope of the linear plot? . E . 3. Consider an experiment in which a student measures the mass and diameter of 10 . different-sized spheres, all made of the same material of uniform density ρ.

            "content": "Link . Design Work . Me and Safin met up after school at Safin’s house, we were able to draw images and sketches using his ipad. We decided to do one screen and replace images with a 2x2 grid with images and text boxes to display the labels. We also finallized our page by putting a text box at the top that gives the question. We also planned out a score page that displays the percent accuracy which represents how many questions they were able to get right. . Design . The design that me and Safin chose was to design our own quiz and eventually come together to make one app that accesses both of our quizzes. The way that We planned this was storing all of our quiz data into one list of dictionary respectively called Basketball and Tennis and we uploaded the lists into the same app. . Data abstraction . We created a huge list that contains dictionarys and whithin the dictionaries there were key and value pairs. Within the answer pair we put all of our answer choices which included pictures, names, and whether they were right or not. This list was easy to parse through and allowed us to use functions that went through these lists and created tests . Managing Complexity . In order to manage the complexity of this quiz, we were able to input many comments and use many functions to ensure that the code is very easy to follow. The comments allow us to communicate what we are doing with each function and what the purpose of the variables are. And the repeated use of the functions allow us to easily call back to a known function that we make and it communicated the purpose of the funciton without having the reader have to understand the code. . Procedural Abstraction . In order to apply the lists into the quiz, we used many functions. The overarching function was the function that called for the quiz and whithin the quiz function we were able to create many different functions. Some functions included changing the selected answer. Changing the pictures and labels as we the the quiz changes question. And another function we used was the finish function that changes the screen to the end and outputs score. . Algorithm implementations . We used many algorithms or functions to make the code more straight forward and less repetitive. Some of them are next question or finish quiz. This was important to our code because it allowed us to call back to that algorithm very easily without having to recode the whole thing over and over again. These algorithms made our code easier to understand and made it more efficent. . Testing . In order to test out our code, we used the console.log to test out what the code would output before implementing it into our code. This way we were able to see what input was given and how we can use that input to advance our quiz. The consol.log function was a very useful tool that went very well with the onEvent block because it allows us to easily detect for when input is given and it allows us to test new strategies and ideas without hurting out code . Challenges . Some challenges was formatting the quiz into the right list and dictionary so we could call to it. This was very tedious and very hard because and syntax errors in the large array stopped the whole code all togther. Another problem that came up and that the variables were not resetting after each function use. In order to solve this we had to make a new function that resets all the variables. . function finish() { setScreen(&quot;finishscreen&quot;); setProperty(&quot;score&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, correct + &quot;/3, which is &quot; + Math.floor((correct*1.0/3)*100) + &quot;%&quot;) onEvent(&quot;backbutton&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;BegginingScreen&quot;); question = 1; correct = 0; selected = null; }); } . This javascript codeblock function allows us to manage our complexity and use an algorithm at the same time. This code block is the finish screen function that changes the screen, and it also outputs the score, to do this it it takes in the variable correct that was made earlier in the code and divides it by 3 and multiplies it by 100 to get a percent. Then it also has the back button inside of the function, so that if you click the button it sends you back to the beggining screen and it resets all the variables. This is a very usefull function because instead of having to say the entire code block over and over again, we can just call the function finish() . Successes . Some of our success came form the onEvent block because it was very easy to use and allowed us to save a lot of time without our code. This Onevent block led to us ultimately creating a working quiz that enabled me and safin to combine the quizes that we made. .",

For example the radius measurements and the thickness measurements. To prevent these human errors, we could use digital measurements to get the exact values. . Synthesis Questions: . In this experiment, if we had used disks with a greater thickness, would the slope of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be the same? Explain. . | The slope of the line of best fit would change because if the thickness increases, the mass would increase and in order for the equation to stay accurate, the slope will have to increase because mass is the dependent variable. The density would be the same because mass and the volume would still increase proportionally. . How would your graph of m versus r2 be different if you had used disks of the same thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m versus r2 plot that represents disks made of steel. . | The line would be different because the slope would be different. The density of steel is 7.85 g/cm^3 however the density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3. In this lab, the slope is pi*height*density and since the density is different by a factor of 2.5, the slope of the steel graph will be 2.5 times greater. . Aluminum equation/graph: 0.015585x -0.042943 . Steel equation/graph: 0.035067x-0.096621 . . 3. Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; . however, their disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to . determine. The group’s m versus r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the density of the unknown material and use the table below to help determine what material their disks are made of. . . Multiple Choice questions: . 1. You perform the same experiment, but this time you plot a linear relationship . between mass and the circumference of the disks rather than the radius. What is the . slope of the linear plot? . E . 3. Consider an experiment in which a student measures the mass and diameter of 10 . different-sized spheres, all made of the same material of uniform density ρ. For this . student to create a linear graph relating the mass of the sphere to its radius r, the . student would need to plot mass m versus which quantity: . C . .",

The entire background including the header and footer was changed to black ad the text was changed | the fonts where changed and the color changed to white | One thing that I had to come accross was the the fonts did not contrast well because it was just black and white and I did not really like that. | Another thing was that the font was different, although it was still legible I liked the old one better | the installation process of getting the themes in was creating a new folder in the _sass folder and putting the darkmode code it, and the process was very smooth | . .",
