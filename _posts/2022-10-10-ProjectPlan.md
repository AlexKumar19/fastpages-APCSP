# Project Goals
- Our initial project plan was to provide inspiration to the users of the app. We were going to do this by using inspirational quotes and using inspiration collabaration between the users. For example users could comment on others goals in order to inspire them to work toward them. After a lot of planning, and the lesson on APIs, our group also decided to implement an API that would import random inspiration quotes and this could be used to inspire the users!

# Design Work
- After planning the design out on Safins iPad, we decided to put out a web app that was similiar to social media, with likes comments profile pictures and stuff similiar to that. This plan includes quotes from people not on the app, as well as inspirational quotes directly from users. This way we will be guaranteed to have enough content.

- In this picture you can see how we have celebritie's quotes on this page. And we will be able to use data collection and databases to store likes, comments, and quotes. 

# Program Purpose & Function
- Provide inspiration to the users
- Allow users to share there goals and find new quotes!

# Data Abstraction
- We will store user data
  - Number of likes
  - Number of comments
  - What the comments are
  - Quotes

# Managing Complexity
- We will use flask folder structure
  - This will allow us to store out data in a organized way without getting confusing

# Procedural Abstraction
- The way we will be able to execute this webstie will be running off of the API system
- By using the inspirational quote API we would have access to the Rapid API database and we can extract quotes.

# Algorithm Implementation
- We will create functions to get the API quotes, this will make it less complex and allows us to pull quotes easily
- We will automate the user input so we can streamline the process of getting the user quotesi nto the database

# Testing
- We will use print functions and the console to test out the output before we put it into our actual Website

# Roles
- Safin: Scrum Leader
- Alex: Back- end
- Kalani- Front End
- Navan Dev ops
