- This final mc was pretty hard compared to the shorter mc practices that we did before.
- Some common errors that I made in the quiz was in 2B. The develop and integrate algorithms. This topic is somewhere that i can work with. In my own code this main idea of 2B would look like creating functions to manage the complexity. I need to work on understanding the purpose more.
- Another main idea that i missed is 4B, evaluating  and testing algorithms. This means that I need to have a better understanding of what these algorithms do because in the quiz I was making a lot of mistakes with finding errors in the code and figuring out what the problems are in the code. This is very important because if I am able to get better at evaluating algorithms I can make my code more organized and find errors faster.
- Along with this, I made a lot of errors with 4C, this is more of the testing and finding errors in my code with algorithms, the questions often showed me code with errors and I would have to find out the error.
