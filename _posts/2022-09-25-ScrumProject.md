# Main Goal
- make a platform where people are able to share their goals and track their own progress as well as support their peers in keeping on track with their goals

# My role
- I am apart of the backend whithing my scrum team, I will manage the code that takes care of tracking likes and comments. Storing the data and allowing everything to work together perfectly so the fromt end would have an easier job of simply making the page look nicer and easier to use. My job as the backend is to make sure all the text boxes would load correctly and store the data and to also make sure that all the links work in sync.

# End Result
- We will hopefully end with a public website that will allow friends and family to communicate and post goals about their daily lives. This website will be nicely decorated and easy to use in order to ensure that the people can find success in their own goals.
