<h1 id="Changing-Theme-from-Minima-to-DarkMode">Changing Theme from Minima to DarkMode<a class="anchor-link" href="#Changing-Theme-from-Minima-to-DarkMode"> </a></h1><p>Some things that I noticed when changing the theme to darkmode was that I could not do it through the index.htmlm and I was forced to do it through the _sass file.</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire background including the header and footer was changed to black ad the text was changed</li>
<li>the fonts where changed and the color changed to white</li>
<li>One thing that I had to come accross was the the fonts did not contrast well because it was just black and white and I did not really like that.</li>
<li>Another thing was that the font was different, although it was still legible I liked the old one better</li>
<li>the installation process of getting the themes in was creating a new folder in the _sass folder and putting the darkmode code it, and the process was very smooth</li>
</ul>
