- FOr this coding problem I misread the problem
- One thing that I need to reflect on is reading the problem more carefully and understanding the problem better
- The correct answer to this problem is C and D because those code segments will output the wrong value because the code segment will look for the first number that is smaller however depending on the data set this will not work because they will not always have the smallest value in the beggining
