### Data Structures including List, Dictionaries, 2D arrays and Iteration (Big Idea 3).
- I plan to create multiple simulations showing off the us of lists and dictionaries and the how they work
- Along with this I plan to also show how to iterate through these, this could be done through a visual simulation where the user can give input and see the iteration in real time
- I want to also explain the uses of lists and dictionaries and explain the how this is data abstraction 
- I can also give a demonstration on how it was used in my CPT projet and how they can implenet the use of these data structures in their CPT projects as well
