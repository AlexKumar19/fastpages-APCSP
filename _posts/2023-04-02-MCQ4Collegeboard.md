- Option A is incorrect because data compression is useful not only for files being transmitted over the Internet but also for files stored on local storage media.Option D is a true statement about data compression. There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data. Different compression techniques have different advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of technique will depend on factors such as the type of data being compressed

### Q2 wrong

- B is wrong bc as the search procedure's code or internal abstractions cannot be modified by the student therefore, the argument passed to the search procedure should be a word, rather than a definition.
- C is right bc The student has knowledge that the procedure performs value searching, but lacks knowledge of the searching mechanism, thus demonstrating the implementation of procedural abstraction.


### Q3 wrong

- C is wrong bc The given code scans the list from the second element onward and compares only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is correct. However, it fails to verify the final element in the list. As the loop terminates when the index equals the length of the list, the last student score in the list will not be compared to the maximum possible score.


### Q4 wrong

- "Backing up data" takes the longest time for a large company (around 10,000 customers) according to the table, with a time of 200 hours.
- Scaling up to a very large company of about 100,000 customers is likely to require more time to back up the data.
- Therefore, "Backing up data" is expected to take the longest amount of time when scaled up for a very large company.
