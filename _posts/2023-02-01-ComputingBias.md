### Intentional or Purposeful bias (Crossover Group Up, 10 minutes)

Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
- From our groups reserach, we conclude that the younger generationsa are often using tiktok
- We also see that the older group using facebook
- 25+ can use facebook while under that goes for Tiktok
- There could be a purposeful exclusion because the divide between the groups is very prominent
- It is not harmful because the different age groups have different interests and the application can cater to those interests
- I think that it is also good for business because it allows the application to focus on one small group of people rather than having to focus on the larger group. With this it can specialize and possibly include features that would cater to the old or cater specific to the young
  
Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
- I think that they use female voices because of the old gender roles. The old untrue gender roles of how women are supposed to be there to help
- Another possible reason for this female voice is that it could be more positive or lighter in tone compared to a male voice; the voice could be more peaceful and better for the ear
- I think that it is not really harmful as you can change the voice
- It could possibly be good for business because it has lighter tones than that of a male voice
- 
Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)
- Many of our opinions subconsciesly stem from the ideas that we see online. Netflix google and facebook often inspire our ideas even though we might not be aware. 
- Often in the news we are given limited perspectives that are biased. And when given these biased viewpoints we tend to follow them because we do not understand the other viewpoints
- One specific exmaple of this is with Google and how often the information on there is based

Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas…
- The owner of the computer thinks that this is intentional because he is claiming that the computer is purposely avoiding him by calling the computer racist. By this he implies that the computer purposely does not recognize his face because it chooses not to. I think this is happening because there is not proper lighting but when the white person goes into fram she reflects off more light which makes it easier for the camera to recognize the perosn versus when he does it, there is less light reflected and the computer cannot see him properly, I think that it has to be corrected because the software should work more often and the lighting was good enough to sense where he was. It is more of a problem with the software rather than the software choosing not to sense him. To produce a better outcome I would make it more accurate and work more often.

### Big Idea 5.4

CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- We could make a blog that all of us could edit, like a BIG group repo where we could add our ideas to it. This could be very helpful because now it will encapsulate all of our classes learning and if someone is behind it is very easy to go learn from another groups learning on the big repo
  
What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?
- Yes my projects would be better because I would be able to crosscheck my learnings and be able to validate my information. It is important to do that because it wil make sure my information that I am presenting is correct. 
  
What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.
- The data that I would collect at the N@tm would be the input and feedback that I get form the parents. This could be very helpful because I can then make my project better and more efficient using their feedback. Their perspectives could be different and offer new ways to improve my project that our group would not be able to understand without the input. This owuld make my final project better because then it would be applicable to multiple perspectives
