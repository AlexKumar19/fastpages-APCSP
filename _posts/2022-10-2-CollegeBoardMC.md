# Collaboration Quiz!
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/COllabQuiz.png)
- One thing that I really liked about this quiz was how it emphasized the importance of having multiple perspectives
  - In my own scrum team, we highly value collaboration and using multiple perspectives to solve problems and this is why I was able to relate to this quiz and it was a good review on the main ideas of working as groups!


# Program Function and Purpose Quiz!

- One Question that I have for this specific quiz is why the equal signs appear as arrows in the college board mcqs
- I also really liked the nested loop question because it took a lot of time to understand it, however in the end I was able to see what the code was doing!


# Program Design and Development Quiz!

- I found the loop that outputs the odd numbers to be very good because it uses many loops to print out the numbers with the least amount of code blocks
- I have the same question again with the arrows and why they don't use equal signs


### Overall I think that these MCQS were good practice and helped me review over these main concepts!
