# Review For Big Idea 2 Quiz
- Here is my score for this quiz 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/BigIdea2Quiz2.png)
- For this quiz I got a 22/25 making a few minor errors
- Some of the skills assessed in the quiz include filtering and sorting data, counting items in a dataset, and identifying advantages of lossless over lossy compression.
- This quiz covers various topics related to data analysis and management, including compression algorithms, analyzing different types of data, using spreadsheets and databases, and working with binary numbers.

- Answer B is correct. Lossless compression algorithms can reconstruct the original data exactly, while lossy compression algorthms cannot guarantee the reconstruction of the original data because they discard some information during the comression process. Therefore, a lossless compression algorithm is often preferred when it is important to preserve the original data without any loss.
- For this question I messed the wording, the losless compressin stores all the data and does not lose ant data. While the lossy compression is simply lossy and will not completely rebuild the data

- Answer A is correct. Compressing the file using a lossless compression algorithm before uploading it reduces the size of the file, while allowing the user to completly restore the file to its original version. This approach meets the users need of reducing the file size while ensuring the ability to fully restore the file to its original version.
- This problem was very simple, as when you want to keep the data you would always go with choosing the losless data. it is the clear obvious answer and I made a simple mistake by putting lossy for the image

- This problem was very challenging for me as I have not had a lot of practice with this
- For this I got one of the correct choices however I did not see that choice D would work as well
- Sorting the spreadsheet by year will put the oldest entries first. If you filter by year, entries without years will be removed. Filtering by photographer will remove entries without a photographer. Filters don't change the entry order, so the photo with the earliest year will be at the top.
- Through this process you will be bble to meet the required set
