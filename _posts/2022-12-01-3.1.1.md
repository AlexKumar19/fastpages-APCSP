num1=input("Input a number. ")
num2=input("Input a number. ")
num3=input("Input a number. ")
add=input("How much would you like to add? ")

# Add code in the space below

numlist = [num1,num2,num3]

# The following is the code that adds the inputted addend to the other numbers. It is hidden from the user.

for i in [int(a) for a in numlist]:
    numlist[i -1] += int(add)

print(numlist)

```python
foods = ["pizza", "hot dog", "sushi", "strawberry", "sandwhich"] #simplified foods list

sports2= "tennis"
sports3 = "soccer"
sports= ["basketball","tennis","soccer"]
```
