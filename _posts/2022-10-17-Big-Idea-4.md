# Internet Quiz
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCQ2.png)
- In the collegeboard videos I was able to go over the main concepts of the internet
- One main concept that I got was that a computing system is essentially multiple computing devices working together to a achieve a certain goal. A computing device is like a computer tablet phone or ipad.
- Next step to this learning was that a computer network is a bunch of comptuing devices and systems working together
- Two computing devices can communicate and send packets to each other
- In order for this communication to take place, a routing has to take place and this will connect the sender to the reciever
- When they talk about bandwith, the are explaining that the max amount of data that can be send or recieved in a given time interval
- A packet is a small amount of data send from a sender to a reciever 
- Packet switching is when the message gets split in order to get sent, and the reciever pieces the pieces back together to get the final message
- A path between two computing devices begins from sender and ends at the reciever
- In order for data to get passed from device to device, it has to be sent through data streams, which contain data whithin packets
- Packets have a chunk of data along with metadata or instructions on where it is supposed to go
- The internet has a set of linked pages are interconnected
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) common standard on how to send messages
- OSI Open systems interconnet layers that you have to go through  to communicate
- The most common network access protocol is Ethernet
- Routers are a special purpose computer with a MAC adress
- The internet is scalable
- LAN (Local Area  Network) physical connections conected physically.
- DNS Domain Name Service Application that changed a URL into an ip address
  - The internet was designed in such a way to be scalable
- Metadata contains information for routing and connecting sender to reciever
- The world wide web is a system of linked pages that can be accessed through the internet

# Future plan for taking notes
- I will continue to take notes in the form of a markdown blog. 
- This way it is easily accesible and I can change them and update my notes. 

# Dev Ops
- Deployment through AWS using deocker through docker compose
- All running on one AWS instance with a conatiner for each group.
- Our group is named striver and we use docker to run it through AWS.
