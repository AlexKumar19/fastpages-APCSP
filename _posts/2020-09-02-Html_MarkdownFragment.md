# Changing Theme from Minima to DarkMode
Some things that I noticed when changing the theme to darkmode was that I could not do it through the index.htmlm and I was forced to do it through the _sass file.
- The entire background including the header and footer was changed to black ad the text was changed
- the fonts where changed and the color changed to white
- One thing that I had to come accross was the the fonts did not contrast well because it was just black and white and I did not really like that.
- Another thing was that the font was different, although it was still legible I liked the old one better
- the installation process of getting the themes in was creating a new folder in the _sass folder and putting the darkmode code it, and the process was very smooth
