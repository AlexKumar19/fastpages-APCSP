### Bash

```bash
cd #cd stands for "change directory"
cd vscode #goes to vscode directory
Ls #tells the user the directory
```
Bash allows us to create scripts that can automatically download packages and navigate the terminal

### Cloud

The cloud is up in the skies near the moon and it allows us to clone repositories down to our solid state drive. This allows us to edit the repositories on out own devices remotely. When you pull, you update your clone and when you push, it adds your changesinto the repository
